# Beauty Salon Web Application

## Overview
This is a web application developed as a final project for my Python course. The application is built using Django, CSS, JavaScript, HTML, and SQLite (db3).
It serves as a platform for a beauty salon where users can book appointments with stylists, leave feedback, and view their own feedback. 
Administrators can manage services and stylists.
